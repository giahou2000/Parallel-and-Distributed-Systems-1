In my undergraduate studies, in the department of Electrical and computer engineering, in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,
we attended the course of Parallel and distributed systems.
This repository holds the scripts in c, that address the first project within the course.
The idea was to solve a problem and then parallelize the execution of the code,
so that it runs faster.
To parallelize the tasks of the algorithm, we use opencilk, openmp and pthreads,
in order to assign the algorithm subroutines in different cpu cores.
